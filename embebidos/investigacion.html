In recent years , the automatic identification procedures (Auto-ID) have come to be very popular in our society. Particularly, Radio Frequency IDentification or RFID has become in one of the technologies more used in different sectors in the industry. The great attraction of RFID is its ability for identifying objects in a wireless fashion, without contact or line of sight between participant devices. Such features makes RFID very attractive for applications like: asset tracking, automated inventory managment, counting task, access control and production, public transportation, and nutrimental control.<br><br>

In this way, RFID needs to have the mechanisms to improve and optimize its performance, since it face many problems, such as: collision resolution, save energy, security, fiability and read range.<br><br>

In order to improve the RFID technology performance in environments dense and with a large coverage area, we propose to use a distributed approach for the design of the RFID network architecture, and then perform the identification process in a distributed fashion. This approach will let us to get many advantages for applications of the real world with a low cost of implementation.<br><br>
